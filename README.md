# STM32F4407

A repository to test barebone embedded programming of arm M4.
As this repo grows, a barebone library for ARM M4 will be created.
Rust Zinc project had been stopped. However, it is a significant project for security and programming style.
Once this project grows, zinc will be continue by my contribution.

At this stage, this repository is to learn and how to program an embedded microcontroller with register programming.
some blinks and button presses are all.
near future, some peripherals, SPI, I2C, USART, and RTC will be tested.


Also detailed explanation will be on [blog.lunarpulse.org](http://blog.lunarpulse.org)
